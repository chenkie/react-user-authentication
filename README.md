# React Authentication for Front End Masters

## Protecting Routes Challenges

* Make an authenticated `GET` request to the `/instructors` endpoint and display the returned resources in the **Instructors** view
* Make an authenticated `POST` request to the `/instructors` endpoint to create a new instructor and return to the **Instructors** route to dispaly the newly created resource
